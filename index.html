							<h1>Somu Sharma</h1>
							<p> Hi, Welcome to my portfolio.
								I'm a DevOps engineer who began the career as a machine learning enthusiast. Over time, I realized that to delivery some solution to real world problem DevOps will the place in which you can explore both the side development as well as operational. So, I needed more than just machine learning knowledge. 
								So, I started exploring the world of DevOps engineering and discovered how automation and infrastructure as code could simplify the process of managing and deploying data pipelines. 
								I learned about DevOps tools like continuous integration and deployment, containerization, and configuration management. 
								I also gained expertise in cloud infrastructure and how to use it to build and scale applications. 
								Now, I'm confident in my ability to design and implement end-to-end solutions for an applications

									<h2>Internships</h2>
									<p>Internships give the first hand exposure working in the real world. It allows us to implement skill, knowlegde and
										 the theoretical practice learnt before. I beleive that it is a learning curve with little experience of the professional world.
										  I have completed two internships through the recent years in my life..</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world.
								It is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around him or her.
								I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.

									<h3>Toonify</h3>
									<p>The problem statement is to develop a trained model that suggests the best music based on an individual's current mood by capturing their facial expressions. The goal is to create an algorithm that can analyze the user's facial expressions through image processing techniques and recommend music that aligns with their emotions, ultimately enhancing their mood and listening experience.</p>

									<h3>Sentiment analysis on covid19 tweets</h3>
									<p>The problem statement involves performing sentiment analysis on tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic using Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model that can analyze the sentiments expressed in tweets related to COVID-19, allowing for a better understanding of public opinion and emotional responses during this challenging time. This analysis can provide valuable insights for decision-making, resource allocation, and gauging public sentiment towards various aspects of the pandemic.

									<h3>Author Identif</h3>
									<p> This project focused on creating a web application similar to Editorial Manager, which is used by publishers to manage the entire editorial process for journals. However, the given application lacked an automatic assignment of papers to reviewers. To address this issue, a logic was implemented based on domain selection, ensuring that if the paper's domain matches an existing reviewer's expertise and they have fewer pending papers, the new paper will be automatically assigned to them. This addition aims to improve efficiency and streamline the paper assignment process within the web application.</p>
