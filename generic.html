							<p><h4><u>E-commerce Bots </u></h4></p>
							<p>Bots are the future of engagement between the user and brand or let us just say, the fan and the celebrity!!
							We are planning to develop a chatbot for client ecommerce website using AWS Lex. We will chat with the user and try and find attributes like their age, gender and if they are interested in the respective product etc. Using these attributes to the apriori algorithm, we will get the products that are most suitable for the user. This will be done using the support and confidence from the algorithm. The bot will then offer these products to the user and help them direct to the website of the respective product. This will increase the engagement of the user with the website.
