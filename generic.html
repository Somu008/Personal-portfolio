							<p><h4><u>Static detection of security mitigations in executables </u></h4></p>
							<p>PROBLEM: To assess the security posture of binary files in a system and identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. 
								SOLUTION: To deal the above-mentioned problem after one week of research. To address the problem of assessing the security posture of binary files and identifying potential vulnerabilities, the proposed solution is to utilize the "checksec" tool. Checksec is a widely used open-source tool specifically designed for scanning and analyzing binaries for security weaknesses.
								<p>
									<p><h3>Technology Stack:</h3></p>
										Dealing with multiple languages as per the product requirement. Mainly using Jenkins, python, checksec tool, winchecksec tool, Docker.
